# Super Mario and the Temple of Time
 Music from the stage musical

Hi there! Welcome to our ReadMe!  Okay so you are probably very curious what this whole thing is.  This is a show that I, Fayaz Shaikh, have personally written and cast, including the scores that were created with Christopher Fields.  I intend to perform this show as a NON-PROFIT to not get in the way of any copyrights on the characters by Nintendo.  Because of this, this project falls under the realm on fan-film.  I am currenlty looking for a theatre in the Raleigh NC area to perform.
